I should insert one of those animated GIFs from the early days of the web with the little guy digging a ditch.

But yes, please note this blog is under construction.  Please mind the gaping holes, dangling electrical wires, etc.  I suppose I could
pull a google and slap a "beta" badge on it...

Comments aren't hooked up yet, no analytics, I need the front page formatted better... you get the picture.  But it's a start.
